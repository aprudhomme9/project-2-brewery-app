### Brewr App


## This app is designed to provide the user with a list of breweries in their area (X Mile Radius), or users can search breweries/beer. Users will login, or register. The user can then check into a brewery as having visited, as well as add beers from that brewery into a list of beers they have tried.

## Beers Index/Beer Show Pages --> 
* User can browse beers through the beers link. Each beer that appears in results will also link to its own page, which will show its model data, as well as it's brewery, which will link directly to that brewery's page. 

* The user can 'check in' that beer, meaning they've had the beer and want to review/rate it.  Checking in will add the beer to the users' beers.


## Add Beer Page --> 
* A user can add a beer that they've recently had but can not find within the site. Certain attributes of the beer will be addded and then displayed on the beer's own page.

* The user can write a public review so that others can gather feedback and information on beers. The user can also write a private note for their own reference, i.e. don't get this beer again, it sucks. For the avid beer drinker, this is a nice refresher on what they have liked and not liked

* The user navigates to this page through brewery show page. This beer then gets added to the respective brewery
